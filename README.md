Hello! This is my Development project: Collecti!

I developed it by starting with the Create React App template, and leaned heavily on Facebook's "Thinking in React" guide (linked at the bottom of my project).

I've only included the src and public files here, since I was able to host my site at https://cvlamis.github.io/cs130-dev/. If you want to run my project locally, you can do so by using the commands "npm install" followed by "npm start".

The entire page's container (header, intro text, and footer) is located in Collecti.js (only slightly modified from the template), but most of the important code in the project (for filtering and displaying data) is located in FilteredTable.js.
